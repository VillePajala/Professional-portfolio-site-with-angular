    <p>Here you can check out some of the code I have made. 
    Mostly I have used Angular, Node.js and Ionic to learn how to make web applications. 
    I also enjoyed tremendeously programming games with Unity and C# and you can 
    find some examples of small games I have made. I've also made small exercises with PHP 
    Python and Java.ngForm</p>

    <p>I have to GitHub profiles - One public and one that contains private repos. The private one constains over 20 projects 
    but as they are school related, I cann't publish the code. If you are a recruiter or 
    someone who want's to asses my skills related to work opprtunities, I have 
    permission to share those projects. If that's the case, you can contact me on the issue.</p>
