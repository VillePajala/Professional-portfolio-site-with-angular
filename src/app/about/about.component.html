      <p>H! My name is Ville Pajala and I am a programmer with a pretty long creative background.
      As a kid I drew constantly and grew up with strong relation to music. Long story short, I ended upp going to art schools
      and finally I was a graduated artist. Later I continued my fine art studies - all the way to master degree.</p>

      <p> have also studied Chinese medicine, which was probably the most life changing period of my life. It gave me a strong 
      holistics philosophical foundation to build on. As a profession, being an acupunctrist was a bit
      off for me, just like being a professional artist.</p>

      <p>Even tough I have played guitar and have some half-baked band projects, I consider my musical path to
      begin when I found electronic music. I found myself to be very comfortable making sounds by programming.
      This was almost fifteen years ago but I can now see how that was kind of my first step into the world
      of programming.</p>

      <p>And now I'm studying computer science and found my true passion in programming. I have to admit that after
      getting into coding, every other interest has dropped almost complitely as I have found
      my true fit. Nevertheless, I find myself to be in a extremely cool palce where I have so many skills to draw from -
      I can build software, create content and have a long experience in art, design and sound engineering.</p>

      <p>I'm glad you found my site (which I, of course, build myself from scratch). Please feel free to check some of the stuff
      I have done out!</p>

      <p>Sincerely yours
      Ville Pajala</p>
